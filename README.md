# wide_deep_with_self_paced_learning
this is the source code for wide&amp;deep with self-paced learning, The word vector is saved in the vec_dict folder. 
If you want to run the code, you first need to decompress the compressed file in the vec_dict folder, and then run python model.py.
if you can not open the folder of location_TCN+FM+SPLD, you can go to https://github.com/shiqiuwang/wide-deep_with_self_paced_learning to get.
